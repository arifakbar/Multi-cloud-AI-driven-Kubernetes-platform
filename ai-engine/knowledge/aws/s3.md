# AWS S3 Security Best Practices

## Overview

Amazon S3 buckets are used to store objects and sensitive data. 
Misconfigured S3 buckets are one of the most common causes of cloud data breaches.

---

## 1. Server-Side Encryption

### Risk
Unencrypted S3 buckets expose sensitive data at rest.

### CIS Benchmark Reference
CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark 3.1:
"Ensure S3 buckets have default encryption enabled."

### Why It Matters
If encryption is not enabled:
- Data theft risk increases
- Compliance violations (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- Insider threats become harder to detect

### Recommendation
Enable one of the following:
- AES256 (SSE-S3)
- AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) — recommended for audit tracking

Terraform Example:
server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
        apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
            sse_algorithm = "AES256"
            }
    }
}

Severity: HIGH

## 2. Public Access Block

### Risk
Publicly accessible S3 buckets may expose confidential data.

### CIS Benchmark Reference
CIS AWS 3.2:
"Ensure S3 bucket public access block is enabled."

### Recommendation
Enable:

- block_public_acls = true
- block_public_policy = true
- ignore_public_acls = true
- restrict_public_buckets = true

Severity: HIGH

## 3. Versioning

### Risk
Without versioning, accidental deletions cannot be recovered.

### Recommendation
Enable versioning to protect against:
- Accidental overwrite
- Ransomware-style deletions

Severity: MEDIUM

## 4. Logging

### Risk
Without access logging, security investigations are limited.

### Recommendation
Enable S3 access logging for audit trails.

Severity: MEDIUM

## Impact Summary

Misconfigured S3 buckets may result in:
- Data exfiltration
- Regulatory fines
- Reputation damage
- Incident response cost escalation
